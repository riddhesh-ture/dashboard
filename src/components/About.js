                    I'm a second-year CSE student at VIT Pune with a hands-on approach to learning through real-world projects. 
                    I've built full-stack apps like a privacy-focused spam detection platform and a farmer support site with 
                    live weather insights. I enjoy working on end-to-end features â€” from frontend interfaces to backend logic and deployment. 
                    Recently, I made a small contribution to the open-source LocalSend project, where I added a UI improvement (a button feature), 
                    and I'm looking forward to contributing more. Outside academics, I like exploring emerging tech, setting up DNS/domains, and 
                    experimenting with tools like Flutter, React, Firebase, and MySQL.
